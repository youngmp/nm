The original version (see version 1 here https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14566v1) was rejected due to the following review, with no appeal.

The new version (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14566v2) sufficiently addresses all concerns.

Reviewer #4:

Page 2, line 9: should be "Van der Pol"

Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2: Since the order for psi and epsilon was not chosen based on any special consideration, does changing this order (while still assuming that it is the same for psi as it is for epsilon) alter any of the results from the forced models?

Section 3.2.1: If doing so would be tractable given the paper's technical limitations, then I would like to see bifurcation parameters similar to the ones in Figures 11, 12, and 13 for varying b. The disappearance of phase-locked states in Figure 13 is especially striking, so I'm curious as to when it occurs.

Discussion: I would like to see some additional material here discussing the cases when the different reductions disagree with each other. Currently, this is touched on in the first paragraph here, but as there are a few interesting cases of this presented in the Results section (for instance Figures 3B and 3H), I think the existing material could be expanded on.


Reviewer #4: The author introduces a scalar reduction method for forced and coupled systems to determine the existence and stability of phase-locked states as a function of coupling strength and heterogeneity. This method is then applied numerically to various biologically relevant oscillators, including the Ginzburg-Landau and thalamic neuron models.

My primary concern is that the paper contains significant mathematical inaccuracies, and the computational results lack sufficient precision. Additionally, several essential tests to validate the numerical simulations are missing. Given these issues, I have serious doubts about the validity of the approach, which poses a significant problem for publication. Below, I provide details supporting this assessment:

1. The averaging performed to system (9) and provided in system (10) appears to be incorrect. Indeed, the classical book "Averaging Methods in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems" by J.A Sanders & F. Verhulst, 1985, suggests a different approach. The system has to be written in the standard form to perfom averaging (see equation 2.6-1 in Section 2.1 of the book). If not, one first needs to reformulate the problem in the standard form (see, for instance, Section 2.4 of the book). This reformulation has not been performed in the equations for the isostable variables $\psi$ in system (9) of the manuscript before applying averaging and indeed, may incur in some errors (see "Section 2.7.6. Counter-example of crude averaging" of the book). This discrepancy may explain why the simulations of the 3D model (averaged system) do not align with the corresponding results for the 1D model in certain examples presented in the results section (Section 3). To ensure mathematical rigor, the author should either provide a formal proof justifying the averaging method or cite an appropriate reference that includes a rigorous derivation.

2. The numerical aspects of the implementation of the method discussed in Section 3 raise concerns about the validity of the approach, which could pose a significant problem for publication. I believe the manuscript has been submitted prematurely with regard to its numerical analysis, as several aspects of the numerics have not been adequately addressed. Below, I outline some of these concerns:

- Page 19. Remark 5. The author states "For this reason, we have no indicators for specific bifurcations throughout this paper." However, the author should be able to identify bifurcation types by analyzing the eigenvalues of equilibria without relying on predefined software packages such as AUTO, particularly for fundamental bifurcations like Saddle-Node or Pitchfork. Therefore, this justification does not seem appropriate for a rigorous mathematical study.

- Fig 2H indicates phase-drift for the corresponding values of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ but the vertical dashed line in Fig 3H showing the bifurcation diagram  predicts phase-locking instead of phase-drift (at least for the 1D-reduction).

- Several figures in the paper exhibit inaccuracies that raise concerns about the reliability of the numerical simulations. For instance, the appearance of new branches in Figures 3A-B (middle), the wiggles in Figure 8H, among others. A thorough validation test of the numerical simulations should be conducted to ensure their accuracy.

- It is suspicious that, in several simulations in the coupling section, the 3D model fails to capture the behavior that the 1D model does (page 26, line 29). It is unusual for an extra simplification to capture a phenomenon that the more detailed model does not. This may be related to the incorrect averaging discussed in my point 1. The statement, "We did not thoroughly investigate the cause for this difference" (page 26, line 35), cannot be accepted in a paper, as it suggests potential errors in the methodology that cannot be overlooked. See also page 29, lines 39-43.

- Page 32. Line 19.  The author states, "The proposed 1D reduction is vulnerable to multiple sources of error that can be difficult to track down." However, sources of error should be identifiable, and if they cannot be properly analyzed, this raises concerns about the reliability of the results.

-  Page 23, line 26. The author states "there is no special consideration in the choice of order, and we use the same order for phi and epsilon". I think that this lacks rigour and special consideration should be devoted to this in order to assess the validity of the results.

- Page 24, line 2. "Unstable phase-locked states of the full model were unable to be obtained" is another example of poor numerics. The author should be able to compute these points with classical numerical methods.

- Page 24, line 42. How do you know about this bifurcation? where is this bifurcation observed?

3. If I understand correctly, the 1D reduction in Equation (25) corresponds to Eq (23) on page 13, which has been derived using the methodology detailed in Section 2.2.2 and developed throughout that section. However, when the 1D reduction eq (25) is introduced on page 14, it is stated that it is "directly related to that used by Park and Wilson in [28, 29]." This raises the question of what is new in this work compared to the approach of Park and Wilson. Clarifying this point is essential for assessing the novelty of the results.

4. Finally, another concern is the presentation of the paper. The main ideas are hidden behind tedious analytical developments and complex notation, making it difficult for non-specialist readers to follow. As a result, the paper primarily targets a very narrow audience already familiar with the topic.

5. Next, I provide additional comments. I have selected the most relevant ones to illustrate that the manuscript has been submitted in a rather premature state, with some parts of the text lacking careful revision and deeper consideration.

- Page 2. Lines 26-27. There is a remarkable lack of references regarding the classical phase-isostable coordinate framework. In particular, works by Guillamon, Huguet, Mauroy, Mezić, Moehlis, Nakao, ...

- Page 3. Eq (1). Should the vector fields F_X​ and F_Y​ be the same? If they are intended to be different, it is unclear why $\delta$ is introduced as the parameter for heterogeneity, given that the system already exhibits differences. Could the author clarify this point?

- Page 3. Line 14. The author states: "Each system in isolation admits a ..." Please indicate what is referred to as system in isolation (eps=0 only? or also delta=0?). I do not understand the assumption that the period is always 2\pi.

- Page 3. Line 17. "For eps=0 ..." I do not understand the difference between isolation in previous paragraph and eps=0. When $eps=0$, the oscillator described by variables X and the oscillator described by variables Y do not interact.

- Page 3. Line 27. "Limit cycles persist ..." you mean slightly perturbed.

- Page 9. I do not understand the sentence "(as opposed to long-term behaviour exhibiting oscillations or chaos)" in Assumption 2.

- Page 9. Eq in lines 28-29. r should be r'. Negative sign in front?

- Page 9. Line 44. theta_x=c+\theta_Y*omega. If you assume this, it implies that the evolution of the $\theta_X$​ and $\theta_Y$​ variables is linked by these relationships. This suggests that you are imposing a fixed dynamic between these two variables, which I do not clearly see (it seems like a strong imposition).

- Page 10. Define what is H(r) in line 1.

- Some edits in writing would help the reader to follow better the developments. I provide some examples, but the author should make an effort to look again in the manuscript and revise in this direction. For instance, in Remark 3 on page 10. Remind the reader about the parameter $b$. Put a label where it has been introduced for the first time and refer to it. The same idea for $\hat K$ and $K$ two lines below.

- Page 12. Almost all math expressions on page 12. Parenthesis missing within the integrals (ds should affect all the summands in the integral).

- Page 12. Expressions for \mathcal{J}_i^(l) in equations in lines 12-15 do not depend on theta_i, neither Z_i and J_i inside the integral. However, the expressions for Z_i and J_i on page 5, they do depend on theta_i. Please, clarify.

- The concept of forcing is not introduced until Section 3.1 on page 15, yet it is used earlier in the manuscript (e.g., line 35 on page 13 and line 38 on page 14). This lack of prior explanation may cause confusion for the reader.

Additionally, the meaning of the 2D reduction on page 14 is unclear without a proper introduction to the idea of forcing. In particular, it is not evident why only $\psi_I$​ is eliminated in this reduction.

- Page 14. Equation (25) what is $a^(l)$?

- Page 16, line 29. $kappa$ is the Floquet exponent and is negative for an attracting oscillator, then where it says "large relative ..." should be in absolute value.

- Page 16. I think that the statement "we use forcing functions with more than one Fourier frequency, e.g., we avoid using forcing functions such as sin(\omega_Y t), because sinusoidal functions generally yield 1:m phase-locking" is not correct. I think that what matters is the frequency relationship between the frequencies of the perturbation and the intrinsic frequency of the perturbed oscillator.

- Page 17. Lines 10-12. The expression is wrong. There a sum in $i$ but $i$ does not appear in the expression and there appears the variable $t$.

- Page 17. Lines 14-16. The type of function the author is attempting to define (essentially a Gaussian function on the circle) can be more precisely described using the classical von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal distribution).

- Pages 18-19. Section 3.3.1. The author studies 2D, 1D and full system, but in some cases full system is referred to as the 3D system (page 19, line 3) and another as full (Caption of Fig 2 line 31; page 19 line 19). Please clarify.

- Page 19. Line 19. "One-parameter bifurcation diagrams" with respect to which parameter? Clarify.

- Page 19. Line 26. "Fourier coefficients" of which function? Clarify.

- The values computed in Fig 4 and similar figures are typically called the rotation number.

- For the examples considered, only the smallest in modulus Floquet exponent is presented. What about the other ones? This is important to identify whether this direction of contraction is significantly slower than the other ones.
